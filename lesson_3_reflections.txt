When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

if we want to share our changes with other people using same repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because there might be changes in my local repository, so i want to decide when to pull instead of automatic.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork is to copy other's repository on github to your profile
clone is to copy remote or local repository into your local
branch is to create another branch on same repository to make different changes
